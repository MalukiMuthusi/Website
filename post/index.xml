      <description>One of my 2021&amp;rsquo;s goal is to read 30 books. These includes technical and non-technical books. I have a reading list at goodreads.com. You can follow me at maluki-muthusi. I would like to see what books you are reading, have read or you are planning to read.
My book list is quite long, but I will highlight some of them here.
