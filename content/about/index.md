Hi, I am Maluki Muthusi.

I am software engineer passionate about technology and its use cases in solving problems.
Some of the programming languages I use are Go, Dart, Java, Kotlin and JavaScript.
I do write cross platform applications using flutter toolkit.
My area of specialization is in the backend technologies that provide APIs.

I believe they is no perfect programming language or framework, but each technology is good at solving some problems.
